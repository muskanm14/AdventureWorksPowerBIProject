I have developed a comprehensive Power BI project for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company, aimed at transforming raw data into high-quality reports to monitor KPIs, analyze regional performance, track product trends, and identify valuable customers. 
The project is structured into four key stages:
	1.	Connecting & Shaping Data:
			•	Establish automated workflows using Power Query for data extraction and transformation.
			•	Explore various data connectors, storage modes, profiling tools, and table transformations.
	2.	Creating a Relational Data Model:
			•	Implement best practices in data modeling, including database normalization, primary & foreign keys, and star & snowflake schemas.
	3.	Adding Calculated Fields with DAX:
			•	Introduce data analysis expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures.
			•	Dive into advanced topics like filter functions, time intelligence patterns, and iterators.
	4.	Visualizing Data with Reports:
			•	Develop engaging reports and dashboards following data visualization best practices.
			•	Enhance interactivity with features like bookmarks, slicer panels, tooltips, and custom visuals.
This project encapsulates the essence of the project's stages, emphasizing data preparation, modeling, analysis, and visualization to drive informed decision-making and insights from the data.
